The desired design is cut out of the selected medium and then the image is transferred to a surface through the use of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Aerosol_paint\">spray paint<\/a> or roll-on paint.<br>The process of stencilling involves applying paint across a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stencil\">stencil<\/a> to form an image on a surface below.

He was influenced by the graffiti artists of New York City but wanted to create something of his own.<br>Australian photographer <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rennie_Ellis\">Rennie Ellis<\/a> documented some of the earliest examples of stencil art to appear in <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sydney\">Sydney<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Melbourne\">Melbourne<\/a> in his 1985 book <em>The All New Australian Graffiti<\/em>. In the introduction to the book, Ellis noted that US photographer <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Charles_Gatewood\">Charles Gatewood<\/a> had written to him and sent him photographs of similar stencil graffiti that had recently appeared in <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_York_City\">New York City<\/a>, leading Ellis to speculate that:<\/div><div><br>... unlike our subway-style graffiti, which is nothing more than a copy of a well-established New York tradition, the symbols of Australia and America had originated separately and unknown to each other.<br><br>Over the years this form of graffiti has become a worldwide subculture. The members are linked through the Internet and the images spray-painted on the urban canvas they place throughout the world. Many of its members connect through blogs and websites that are specifically built to display works, get feedback on posted works, and receive news of what is going on in the world of stencil graffiti.<br>Stencil graffiti is illegal in some jurisdictions, and many of the members of this subculture shroud their identities in aliases. <a
